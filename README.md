# Expense Tracker

## Expense tracker web application built using the MERN stack. (Ongoing)

This project features a web application built using the MERN stack that will serve as an expense tracker for the user.

The frontend is built using React. It consists of an input form where the user will add the expense information. The input form utilizes React Bootstrap for the design. It also consists of a data table where the different expenses will be displayed. The table is built using material-ui components and contains icons from FontAwesome.

The backend is built using Express and utilizes MongoDB for our database. The user will be able to interact with our database with CRUD operations.

By connecting the backend to the backend, we are able to populate our Redux store with the transactions from our database. The database is also updated with the proper data whenever we also update our store with information from our frontend.

Next features to be added: 
Displaying the data in graphs and filtering by date range/months.
